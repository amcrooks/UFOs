## Overview
- For this challenge, we need to build a table on a webpage for Dana to have all her research on UFO sightings for users to search.

### Results
- Using the table provided on the webpage you have five categories on the table you can use to search for UFO sightings.
- We built an html page with tags and customized the page with graphics and color.
- The data provided by Dana was imported onto our JavaScript to create a table to display filtered results.

### Summary
- One drawback of the webpage is that an image evidence is not available with search results.
- As a developer would add media of videos/ pictures that people have taking of the UFO sightings. We could also add a comments section for people to wirte their thoughts about the sightings
